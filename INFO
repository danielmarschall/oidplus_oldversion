This is the first (and last) public release of OIDplus 1.0

The project OIDplus 1.0 was used internally at ViaThinkSoft
and was eventually replaced by OIDplus 2.0

OIDplus 1.0 is not developed anymore, so please use OIDplus 2.0 instead:
https://oidplus.viathinksoft.com/

This code was released after OIDplus 1.0 has already been deprecated for a long time,
because we think that parts of the codes might be still interesting
and we don't want to simply throw it away.

OIDplus 1.0 comes with test data that was actually the real ViaThinkSoft database,
but a few confidential things have been removed and some example stuff has been added.
The data was included in the public release to help you better understand
how the database structure and macros work.
